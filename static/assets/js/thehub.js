            Controls for Do-Not-Track features Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications offer a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting that signals your preference for not having your online browsing activities tracked and collected. As of now, there is no universally accepted standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals. Consequently, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically conveys your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is established in the future and we are required to comply with it, we will inform you about the practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.
